Welcome to My Shopping Site
This is my own shopping site created using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
Product Fetching: Products are fetched from a dummy site and stored in a PostgreSQL database. 
Users can add products to their cart, and the purchase will be processed after they enter the required information. 
If the user is not logged in, the functionality of the website is limited.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic User Experience: When logged in, users can:
Access their order history.
Add products to a wishlist and view it.
Submit reviews for products.
Have their information automatically filled in on the cart page, with the option to modify it if needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created a real-time functional URL using image.yml and a Dockerfile for deployment. You can check out my site at the following links:
